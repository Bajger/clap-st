# clap â€” Command line argument parser for Pharo
[![Build Status][travis-status]][travis]

Named after and inspired by [clap-rs](https://github.com/kbknapp/clap-rs), but
this is an independent implementation.

Currently still in the design discovery phase; tests use [Mocketry](http://smalltalkhub.com/#!/~dionisiy/Mocketry).
